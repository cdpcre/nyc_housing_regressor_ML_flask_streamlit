## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Health Check

```bash
# Replace with your deployment URL
curl https://your-app-url.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

### Single Prediction Test

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-url.com/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brokertitle": "Brokered by COMPASS",
    "type": "Condo for sale",
    "beds": 2,
    "bath": 1.0,
    "propertysqft": 800.0,
    "sublocality": "Manhattan"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "price": 1323814.25,
  "price_formatted": "$1,323,814",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "model_version": "20250110"
}
```

### Load Testing (Optional)

```bash
# Using Apache Bench
ab -n 100 -c 10 -T 'application/json' \
  -p test_payload.json \
  https://your-app-url.com/predict
```

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Render.com Monitoring

- View logs in Render dashboard
- Monitor service health and metrics
- Set up alerts for downtime

### Railway.app Monitoring

```bash
# View deployment logs
railway logs

# Check service status
railway status
```

### Streamlit Cloud Monitoring

- Check app metrics in Streamlit dashboard
- View usage statistics
- Monitor resource consumption

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables, not in code
2. **HTTPS**: All platforms provide HTTPS by default
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for production
4. **API Keys**: Implement API key authentication if making publicly available
5. **CORS**: Configure CORS headers appropriately for your use case

---

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

| Platform | Free Tier | Limitations | Best For |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Render** | ‚úÖ Yes | 750 hrs/month, sleeps after inactivity | Production demos |
| **Railway** | ‚úÖ Yes | $5 free credit/month | Quick deployments |
| **Streamlit Cloud** | ‚úÖ Yes | Public repos only | Data science apps |
| **Google Cloud Run** | ‚úÖ Limited | 2M requests/month free | Scalable production |
| **Heroku** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | No free tier (as of 2022) | Enterprise apps |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: App crashes on startup**
```bash
# Check logs for error messages
# Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt
# Verify model files are included in deployment
```

**Issue: "Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Solution: Add missing package to requirements.txt
# Rebuild and redeploy
```

**Issue: App sleeps/cold starts**
```bash
# Free tiers often sleep after inactivity
# Solution: Use a scheduled ping service to keep alive
# Or upgrade to paid tier
```

**Issue: Model file too large**
```bash
# Solution: Use git-lfs for large files
git lfs track "models/*.joblib"
git add .gitattributes
git add models/
git commit -m "Add large model files with git-lfs"
```
